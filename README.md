## CLIFF
- [A] HELLO - _Disk belongs to..._

- [A] NUTTY - _Shows a magnificent picture of the chosen weather (but only if you select sunny)_
- [A] TARGET - _An improvement on CLIFFY that uses the paddle. Doesn't seem to work though_
- [A] LETS MAKE A DATE - Calculates various date based things. According the the comments inside, it was written by me. I even added my phone number which was just 324 at the time!
- [A] SHOOT THE TARGET - _Now we're rocking! I made a hi-res gun and pressing the paddle button shoots at the target! What a game!_
- [A] KEY-BLEEP (Cider Press) - _Causes every key to make a different note while typing normally_
